# Automated Website tests

I used to have a personal website as an accessibility expert. I use it now as a study case for automated tests in Selenium.

## Test cases 
### Already written
- Is contact form working properly?
- Is home page language set to polish?
- Is bio page language set to polish?
- Is cookie panel closing when ok or X is submitted?
- Is Bio note linking to correct page?
- Does the picture have alternative text?

### In progress
- Is UI communicating properly, when incorrect data is submitted in contact form?

### To write (more will be added)
- Is write to me link guiding to contact form?
- Does the form fields have alternative text and correct tags?
- Does return to home page link works?
- Do the paragraph links guide to correct paragraphs?
